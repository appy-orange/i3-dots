My personal i3 dots config...

Even though there is a script to install my dots. I do not RECOMMEND you install this onto your personal workstations/laptops. It MAY or MAY NOT work for you.

you may try them in a virtual machine. I build this is arch linux with lightdm as my login manager and grub as my bootloader
